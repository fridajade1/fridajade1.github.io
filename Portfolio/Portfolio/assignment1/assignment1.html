    <p> The article “Design is dead. And we have killed it.” is about how times are changing when it comes to technology and the most crucial part of this article which is design. With up and coming technology more specifically AI, has gotten so advanced that it is learning many everyday to day job’s which means it is putting actual people at risk with losing their livelihood and careers. The writer for this article is named Michael F. Buckley states, “Many people see AI as an extension or tool — something to help us become better designers. But AI is more than a technological advancement like smartphones or the internet.<strong> It is poised to reshape our world and permanently alter our existence."</strong></p>

<p>Buckley proceeds to express, “Throughout this experience, users must interact with countless touch-points, highlighting the significance of design for navigating complex information. This example shows that design plays a fundamental role in even the most mundane tasks. But what happens when AI replaces this entire process? If not already, users will go to their favorite AI application and ask the same question about green tea. But this time, they will not have to sift through dozens of designed websites. And instead of going to an online store to purchase green tea, they will just ask AI to recommend the best tea based on your given parameters. No more searching through hundreds of products to find the right one. In the process mentioned above, the only design experienced is that of the AI interface. The role of design as a way of organizing complex information or acting as a persuasive tactic becomes irrelevant.” What is happening here is that before when someone would do a task such as a designer setting quiz or something it would take a lot of steps to get to the point and now that AI is advancing it is now taking less steps into the process, to even showing other recommendations based on what you are looking for.<p>
	It goes more into depth in the article by AI now taking everything when it comes to what you search for and with all your data in the future. In the text it states,”Further into the future, personalized databases will recommend  predictive content and products based on user behavior and health. Imagine your AI assistant saying, “Hey, based on your increased cortisol levels, it seems like you’re stressed. May I recommend switching to green tea? Here are some recommended products. Can I add one to your cart?” And it’s not limited to search engines, brands, websites, and packaging — even digital products risk becoming obsolete. In the scenario above, instead of purchasing green tea to reduce stress, AI may offer you a built-in breathing app customized to your preferences. Goodbye, app store. “ I believe that is a scary thought that people are actually letting this happen and continuing  to adapt more that is necessary. Personally I may not have the best source of information on why I think it is bad however my reasoning is that all those movies where technology starts to create a mind of its own and ends up backfiring on society such as the movie “I, Robot” or “The Terminator” and to even “Blade Runner.”<strong> And that is just a few I can think of and even AI may seem like a harmless thing people should really consider if it is really worth people losing their jobs and livelihoods they worked so hard for just for it to be thrown away.</strong> With that being said writer Buckley proceeds to say, “Whether you are a seasoned designer or just starting out, you should be terrified. The unknown is frightening. The only solace anyone can have is knowing that the future is uncertain and that having an open mind and being adaptable are the only skills we can ever truly maintain over time. I hope to God I’m wrong (see what I did there). Perhaps designers and design will endure because people recognize the value of the human element in design, not just the end result.” </p>
