       <p>“Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows... I don’t care how tough you are – it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done!”</p>

<p>Overall life can be stressful sometimes and we tend to give up the second things get hard or doesn't go our way and we let ourselves fall into a hole that not many people ever get out from. Life isn't perfect, far from it, it is messy, chaotic and hard but those experiences are worth it. This is one of my favorite quotes of all time because he is trying to say it is about life sometimes sends you obstacles and how you handle it will determine your character, you want to always give things your all, all 100% of your efforts because a life in fear without trying and regretting not doing the things you were in fear of is not living life. This quote is from the movie Rocky Balboa, it is the sixth film of the Rocky Franchise.
