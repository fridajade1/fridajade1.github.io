  <p> After reading the essay, 404 Page Not Found by Kate Wagner, if I interpreted what the message was trying to put across it is that the older generation of the internet is dying due to the constant evolution of the Internet, to be specific with apps such as Facebook, Instagram etc. Wagner mentions how certain apps were meant for specific classes. I found it interesting how if you use a certain app you were considered ghetto whereas another app you were considered smart. In the text it states,"One of the more interesting essays from and about the late-Myspace to early-Facebook period came from danah boyd, who wrote about the class divisions inherent to certain social media platforms." Wagner furthers her experience by stating in the text, "One white teen, for instance, called Myspace a "ghetto,"  and another described Facebook as "the place where the honors kids got together and discussed how they were procrastinating over their next AP English essay." </p>

<p> Apparently there have been huge cultural differences since Facebook was first designed for those who attended Ivy League schools. It was more for the elite compared to MySpace which was meant for fun but was seen as kids that were not a part of the elite status. Continuing on with how parents viewed states, " Parents, who were often spurred by the moral panics (often racialized) surrounding inappropriate social media use on the anarchic Myspace, began to view Facebook as a cleaner, less seedy alternative for their children." I see it as very sad and shameful how teenagers and adults were separating something as little as apps on a computer just because it was a new thing and for some reason want to keep separating things that have to do with your status or income, it does not make any sense. Kate Wagner had a point where it was inconvenient something like this happened in the early stages of social media and apps. What I don't understand is her point or maybe I interpreted it differently in what her point she was trying to get across but in the end of the essay where she states, "It's important to note here the subversive, deliberately ugly aesthetics of so-called ." Weird Facebook." groups, with titles like ."Please show to Jim ! ! HA ! ! HA ! ."  or "we are all god's children and he left us in a hot car."  These groups are devoted to niche or surrealist humor, usually mocking the rest of the site's aging denizens, and often rooted in a similarly vague (and deeply irony-poisoned) anti-consumerist or anti-capitalist ideology as vaporwave."</p>

<p> In this sentence to be honest I did not understand her point. Was she upset because people have too much freedom on the internet and or how every app had their own in a sense aesthetic? Or was it people could create any kind of page that could offend people? How I interpreted what she said is that she contradicted herself saying social media back then was not sunshine and rainbows the proceeds to end her conclusion with saying bring the old social media back the way it was instead of in her words "It's about time for a little revenge from the old internet. Or how about revenge from the older, older internet: communism. In the words of Marx: "All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify." All that is solid melts into air, bitch." It was a fun read, however I still do not understand what her point was in general and hopefully I did not read it wrong.  </p>
