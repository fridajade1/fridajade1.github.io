<p><strong>Something I love sharing about myself is that I am a first generation latina and I was raised by a single mom and although sometimes it can be discouraging with many disadvantages not coming from a lot , I have come this far thanks to the woman that raised me and I am excited to see what the future holds for me. </strong></p>
