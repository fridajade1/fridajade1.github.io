<h2>About me:</h2>
  <p> I am a transfer student studying to recieve my game programming degree. I've always been good at video games growing up and was into them. I had a dog named Pucca who I grew up with who is unfortuntely not here anymore but who I think is a huge part of me. She was 13 years old when she passed away, she was not your normal dog she was the sweetest, laziest and smartest dog you could have ever known, sometimes I think she was human the way she acted lol. </p>
