     <h2>Welcome to the Lashes for Dummies Page!</h2>
      <h2>This is a website page to inform you on what kind of lashes you want to get for your next appointment. It can be a little tricky and confusing on which is which but here is a guide to make it easier for you!</h2>
  <div id="lash1"></div>
  
<section id="one">
    <p> <strong> Number 1: </strong> Right above are classic eyelash extensions, they are – as their namesake – classic. They are simple, beautiful, natural-looking lash extensions. They are applied on a 1:1 ratio, which means one extension on one natural lash. This allows you to achieve an understated, natural enhancement.</p>
  </section>
 


    <div id="lash2"><!--<p>***Brief message***</p>-->
 
    
    </div>

    <section id="two">
  
    <p><strong>Number 2:</strong> Right above are hybrid lashes, these are a combination one-to-one Classic lashes and Volume fans with 4-8 lashes in each fan. The Hybrid style gives your lash line a little more volume than the classic look and offers three levels of fullness - Natural, Medium and Maximum.</p>
    </section>
    
      <div id="lash3"></div>
       <section id="three">
  
    <p><strong>Number 3:</strong> Right above are volume eyelash extensions, they vary from the natural look which adds more length than volume. Volume lashes instead give a fuller, thicker lash look. The lashes range from 2D-6D – meaning 2 fake lashes to 6 fake lashes per one natural lash.</p>
    </section>
    
     <div id="lash4"></div>
       <section id="four">
  
    <p> <strong>Number 4: </strong>Last but not least these are Mega Volume, they are the lightest lash to make a fan with up to 16-20 lash extensions. Bold and beautiful lashes which definitely lives up to its “Mega” name, and creates a super full and glamorous look.</p>
